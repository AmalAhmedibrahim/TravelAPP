# Plan Your Vacation
# Overview

build a travel application containing a simple form that obtains information on the user's upcoming destination and departure date. With the help of external APIs - Geonames, Dark Sky, and Pixabay, the app then displays the weather and an image of the location on that given date. This is part of my Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree.

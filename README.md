# Plan Your Vacation
# Overview

To build a travel application that contains a simple form which obtains information on user's upcoming trip - destination and departure date.
With the help of external APIs - Geonames, Dark Sky and Pixabay, the app then displays weather and an image of the location on that given date. 
This is part of my Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree.
